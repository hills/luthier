Luthier: automated builds
=========================

Luthier will automate the fetching and building of something. Where
sensible, it saves the results and notifies developers where
necessary.


Setting up
----------

Create a 'builds' directory to use as scratch/workspace:

  $ mkdir mywork

In that directory, a script defines a set of actions;

  $ vi builds/luthier.sh

Take a look at the example file for what these functions are
and why they exist.


Running
-------

This command will run the most recent automated build, and notify
where necessary:

  $ luthier --verbose --builds mywork build

It's designed to be run from crontab or non-interactive environment,
by being silent except on fatal errors; build errors are emailed
separately. This is the command to put in a crontab:

  $ luthier --builds /path/to/mywork build

Other useful commands are:

  $ luthier freshen     # force rebuild even if fingerprints match
  $ luthier list        # list current builds
  $ luthier purge       # purge old builds

The default path for builds is the current directory, so interactive
commands are easiest run like that.
